# PeopleListApp

This is very simple apps in terms of UI. Creating this app was provoked by the desire to learn Unit Testing as well as UI Testing. Mocking URLSession and testing errors is implemented. This is app created with Youtube creator @tundsdev during his "iOS Take Home Project" playlist. I highly recommend it to everyone eager to learn about testing. Great resource!
